# ECE532Project_Mason
Repository for my ECE532 project.

The Raw data (unprocessed) is available in TestingData_norm.csv

The data was processed using MATLAB: PreProcRawData.m into RawData.mat (read by all other files)

The original Least Squares Regression code is ProjectStartUp1_LeastSquares.ipynb

The Least Squares Classification code is ProjectRevisit_LeastSquares-Classifier.ipynb

The complete K-means work is in ProjectStartUp2_KMeans-V2.ipynb (earlier workspace for k-means is in ProjectStartUp2_KMeans.ipynb)

The main neural network code is ProjectStartUp1_NeuralNetwork.ipynb

All PDF files are completed runs with titles that explain differences when multiple pdfs exist for the same main method.
